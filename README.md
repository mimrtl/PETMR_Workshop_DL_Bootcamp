# PETMR_Workshop_DL_Bootcamp

This git repository was used for a small Deep Learning Bootcamp that occured on 10/26/2019 at the SNMMI-ISMRM PET/MR Workshop in New York City (https://petmr2019.snmmi.org). This is based on a bootcamp run at the University of Wisconsin (https://github.com/kmjohnson3/ML4MI_BootCamp)

# Getting access to the data
**Pre-requisite: A Google Acccount.**
1. Please complete the brief survey here: https://forms.gle/RjeWW82m1YgcdpF86
2. You will be invited to the shared data: **PETMR_WORKSHOP_DL_BOOTCAMP_DATA**
3. Next, add this to your Google Drive by following these steps:
    1. Go to https://drive.google.com
    2. On the left, click **Shared with me**
    3. Click the folder **PETMR_WORKSHOP_DL_BOOTCAMP_DATA**
    4. In the top right, click **Add to My Drive**
    5. Now you are ready!

# Running the bootcamp exercises
This bootcamp will go through two simple hands-on examples to develop a classification model and an image segmentation model. The excerises will be run through Google CoLab (https://colab.research.google.com). Simply click on the **Open in CoLab** link at the top of the page from within GitHub. This will open a Jupyter Notebook using Google's CoLab service.
