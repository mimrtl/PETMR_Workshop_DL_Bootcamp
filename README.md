# PETMR_Workshop_DL_Bootcamp

These are the files used for a small Deep Learning Bootcamp that occured on 10/26/2019 at the SNMMI-ISMRM PET/MR Workshop in New York City (https://petmr2019.snmmi.org). This is based on a bootcamp run at the University of Wisconsin (https://github.com/kmjohnson3/ML4MI_BootCamp)

# Getting access to the data

  3. Click the folder **PETMR_WORKSHOP_DL_BOOTCAMP_DATA**
  4. In the top right, click **Add to My Drive**
  5. Now you are ready!

# Running the bootcamp exercises
This bootcamp will go through two simple hands-on examples to develop a classification model and an image segmentation model. The excerises will be run the Google CoLab. Simple click on the **Open in CoLab** link at the top of the page from within GitHub. This will open a Jupyter Notebook using Google's CoLab service.

1. **Exercise 1** MRI Sequence Type Detection: https://github.com/mimrtl/PETMR_Workshop_DL_Bootcamp/blob/master/MRI_Sequence_Detection.ipynb
2. **Exercise 2** CT Lung Segmentation: https://github.com/mimrtl/PETMR_Workshop_DL_Bootcamp/blob/master/Lung_Segmentation.ipynb
